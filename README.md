## Project Overview

This project focuses on building an automated text preprocessing pipeline for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. The goal is to clean, normalize, and prepare raw textual data for further machine learning or deep learning models such as sentiment analysis, text classification, or topic modeling.
By applying steps like tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, and feature extraction (TF-IDF, Word2Vec), this project demonstrates how preprocessing improves model accuracy and efficiency.

🏗️ ## Introduction

Raw text data often contains noise — punctuation, stop words, typos, and inconsistencies. This project builds a modular preprocessing system to transform unstructured text into clean, machine-readable input for NLP models.

🎯 ##Objectives

To clean and standardize raw text data.

To remove unwanted noise like punctuation, numbers, and stop words.

To normalize words using stemming and lemmatization.

To extract meaningful features using BoW, TF-IDF, or Word2Vec.

To demonstrate how preprocessing affects model accuracy.

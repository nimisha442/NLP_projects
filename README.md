## Project Overview

This project focuses on building an automated text preprocessing pipeline for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. The goal is to clean, normalize, and prepare raw textual data for further machine learning or deep learning models such as sentiment analysis, text classification, or topic modeling.
By applying steps like tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, and feature extraction (TF-IDF, Word2Vec), this project demonstrates how preprocessing improves model accuracy and efficiency.
